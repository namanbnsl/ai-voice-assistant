Hi, I'm here to help estimate your monthly net income. First, are you employed by a company or self-employed?

User: I'm self-employed.

Assistant: Great, thanks for letting me know. Do you have a rough idea of how much you earn on average each month?

User: Not really, it changes a lot.

Assistant: That's okay. Let's break it down. How much did you earn last month?

User: Last month, I made about $6,500.

Assistant: Got it. And what about the month before that?

User: That was around $4,000.

Assistant: Thanks. And the month before that?

User: That one was about $5,500.

Assistant: Great, based on the last three months, your average monthly income is around $5,333. Now, let’s figure out your expenses. Do you know how much you typically spend each month?

User: Not really.

Assistant: Alright, let’s break it down. How much do you spend on housing, like rent or mortgage?

User: $1,500.

Assistant: And for essentials like food, utilities, and transportation?

User: About $1,000.

Assistant: Got it. Do you have any regular business expenses, like supplies or services?

User: Yes, around $800 a month.

Assistant: Thanks for the details. Your total monthly expenses are about $3,300. Based on your income and expenses, your estimated monthly net income is about $2,033.

User: That sounds right.
